           <p>Discussion On Bias</p> 
           <p>Firstly I would like to discuss the potential bias in my sample group. The first trend I notice amongst my group is that it contains a large amount of RPG players.  This may mean that the amount they enjoy the game could be biased as they will enjoy the parts of the game that are shared with RPG games.<img src = “https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miKuZune/comp210-interface-evaluation/master/images/GamesPlayed.PNG" width = "146" height = "201" alt = "GamesPlayed.png">
            </br> </p>
<p>The next thing I have noticed is that there is a gap in the gender of my play group (75% male, 25% female). This will likely mean the female demographic of players is not well represented across the play group, and their responses may not be indicative of everyone within that demographic. 
Additionally all players have similarly high amounts of experience as gamers (12+ years) and most spend significant amounts of time playing games each week (average 20.8 hours per week). This may affect how easy it is for them to play the game, as it means they are more likely to have played something which is similar, making it easier for them to play the game. </p>

          <h2> 
            <p>
                While players had mixed feelings about how fun the game was, many players said that it was less fun or more difficult because of the lack of User Interface and feedback in the game. This indicates, quite reliably, that the player’s interaction with the game was made more difficult by the fact that they were not given certain critical information.
