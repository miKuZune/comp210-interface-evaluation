           <p>Discussion On Bias</p> 
           <p>The first trend I notice amongst my group is that it contains a large amount of RPG players.  This may mean that the amount they enjoy the game could be biased as they will enjoy the parts of the game that are shared with RPG games.
            </br> </p>
<p>The next thing I have noticed is that there is a gap in the gender of my play group (75% male, 25% female). This will likely mean the female demographic of players is not well represented across the play group, and their responses may not be indicative of everyone within that demographic. 
Additionally all players have similarly high amounts of experience as gamers (12+ years) and most spend significant amounts of time playing games each week (average 20.8 hours per week). <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTHTSj_3ATOkposQx0EEJ-ff7IHQe6hJmZtqPnQS-h5WT9-vpzaQ0_0VgeSwXbLY0TJ5zMnurfBxPex/pubchart?oid=773255738&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>This may affect how easy it is for them to play the game, as it means they are more likely to have played something which is similar, making it easier for them to play the game. </p>

         <h2>Discussion on results from Hueristic Evaluation: </h2>
         <p> The main problems found with from this evaluation were the lack of feedback when hitting enemies and getting hit by enemies, and the lack of UI to help the player know their current state, such as their health. The menu, while easy to navigate, did not have all the functionality that the menu would suggest. Additionally it was found that the narative of the game was very unclear in the gameplay and it was difficult to build an emotional connection with the characters and the game. </br> 
   </br> While player's did not notice the lack of usabillity of the menu functions, player interviews helped to further back up the fact that there was a lack of feedback in combat and lack of UI such as health, which took away from the fast paced gameplay that has been developed and overall meant that the players seemed to be having less fun or were getting more stressed, which harmed the overall user experience. </p>

          <h2> 
           <p> Discussion on player experience: </p>
            <p>
                While players had mixed feelings about how fun the game was, it was clear that many players experience was made less enjoyable by the apparent lack of feedback and in game User Interface. This indicates, quite reliably, that the playerâ€™s interaction with the game was made more difficult by the fact that they were not given certain critical information, to help them whilst playing.   </br>
                The issue with the menu options not being operational, while not noticed during the player interviews, may also be a cuase of a lessened player experience. As the player will have less options in how they play the game they may find the game less inherently fun and contribute to a less than satisfactory experience.
