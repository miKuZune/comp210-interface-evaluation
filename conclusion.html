          <h2>List of major issues found, in order of importance:</h2>
         <p> - Lack of feedback when hitting enemies and when being hit by enemies. </br>
       - Lack of user interface to give the player critical information.</br>
     - Lack of functionality in menu options.

         <h2> Lack of feedback. </h2>
         <p> To fix the lack of feedback, I think it would be best to add a particle effect when your weapons hit an enemy, preferably something that looks like the colour of blood.</br>
         Additionally I think a overlay blood effect should be shown on screen when the player is hit by an enemy. Something similar to this <img src = "https://forums.unrealengine.com/filedata/fetch?id=1180483&d=1460909582" width ="200" height = "200"> </img></br>
         I think these features will help the player to understand what is happeneing in the game better, as they will give a clear visual representation of the events that have been triggered. Which is the easiest way for players to interpret the information being conveyed by the game.

          <h2> Lack of user interface to give critical information </h2>
         <p>
          Adding a health bar in any corner which gives live updates on how much health the player currently has will help the player to understand the current state of their player. I personally think that there should be numbers used to help represent the players health. As the maximum amount of health a player can have changes, meaning a percentage bar will not be able to accuratley protray how much health the player has. Something similar to this <img src="http://i.imgur.com/OZ4M01N.png" width ="200" height = 200> </img></br>
          This will enable the Player to see how much health they have in two different ways, which will help those who interperate certain types of data better than others types to clearly see how much health they have at any given time. This will help the player have a better overall experience and enjoy the game more.

         <h2> Lack of functinality in menus. </h2>
         <p>
          Adding functionality to the menus, such as the ability to change the resolutions, will help the player experience as it will mean they have more options as to how they play the game. This will help the user experience as they will feel less restricted to a certain way of playing, which will harm their user experience.
