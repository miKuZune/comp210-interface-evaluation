          <h2>Overview:</h2>

	  
	<p>For this evaulation I will start by performing a hueristic evaluation, where I will ask developers to play the game and find what is wrong with it. I will then host a set of interviews with palyers. I will use the hueristic evaluation to find the most obvious bugs and problems, and I will use the interviews to attempt to back up the heuristic results as well as find smaller bugs that may be more difficult to find in a smaller sample size.</br>From these interviews I will collect mostly qualitative data. The quantitative data I collect will be on demographics. </br>
	I will collect data by observing players playing the game and interviewing them after they have played. This will help me identify player trends in what they think about the game and how they play the game. </br>
	The quantitative data will help me to evaluate trends in the player demographics, which may reveal trends in different player demographics. </br>
	By observing the player certain details that the player may miss out during the interview may be picked up on and recorded. </br>

		Justification of methodology: </br>
		By interveiwing my play testers I believe I will be able to collect a lot of meaningful and in depth data about the player's experience. However using this method is very time consuming and will mean there will be less time for a larger sample size. I believe this is justified however by the quality of their answers and the insights that can be made from what the playtesters say.</br>
		Interview pitfalls:</br>
		May be subject to: bias, error, misunderstanding or misdirection. (As listed here: http://www.idr-consortium.net/LR_Interviewing_Re-InterviewingMethods.pdf)</br>
		To avoid these issues I have tried to ensure that each question was clear to the interviewee and have tried to steer the conversation to only produce answers with meaning to the usability of the software.</br>
		Observing player's while they play, while also very time consuming, will allow me to make further insights into the player's experience. This suffer's from the same difficulties as interviews, however I belive that the extra insights from observing a player will lead to more interesting insights into how player's interact with the game. </br>
		Collecting demographic data, I belive, is important as it allows me to make insights into potential bias that the play group may have. This will help to overcome the issue of having a small group size which may not represent the full demographic of player's well, as trends that stem from these bias may be noted before drawing conclusions from the results.</br>

		<h2>Interview base questions: </br> How old are you? </br> How many years have you been playing games? </br> How many hours a week do you spend playing games? </br> What types of games do you play? </br> Was the menu easy to use? </br> Was it quick to change between menu sections? </br> How quick and easy was it to get into game? </br> Did you enjoy the gameplay? </br> What was your end score? </br>Was it easy to understand what you were meant to be doing? </br> Did you find the game difficult </br> Would you recommend the game to a friend? </br>   </h2>
