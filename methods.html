          <h2>Overview:</h2>

	  
	<p>During this evaluation I am going to collect mostly qualitative data. However I will also collect quantitative data on player demographics. </p>
        <p>My qualitative data will be obtained by interviewing the players after they have played the game. These questions will help me to obtain data on the trends in players and trends in how the players feel about the game.</br></p>
	<p>Through these questions I will also be able to obtain quantitiative data about the players, such as average age of players. This will help me in determining if the sample of player's is biased. </br> Additionally I will observe the players as they play. This will help to obtain data on similar ways player's play the game that they may not answer through the interview. </p>
